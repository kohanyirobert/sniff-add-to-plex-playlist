= About

Helper script for `aws-lambda-sniff-sftp`.

Invoked through `SSH_COMMAND`.

. Locates Plex library (by `section_title`).
. Initiates a refresh and waits for it to finish.
. After that it tries to find an item in the library (by `item_title`).
. If it's found it's added to a playlist (located by `playlist_title`).

**Note**: check `requirements.txt` to see dependencies.

= Example

```
nohup python -u main.py <url> <token> <section_title> <playlist_title> '{}' &> out.log &
```

**Note**: `-u` means unbuffered output.

* `url` - By default the URL should be `http://172.17.0.23:32400`, not sure why.
* `token` - Follow https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/[this guide to find the token]. In short, _Get Info_ on an item > _View XML_, the `X-Plex-Token` is amongst the query parameters in the URL.
* `section_title` - Name of the Plex library to refresh.
* `playlist_title` - Name of the Plex playlist to add the item. 
* `'{}'` - Placeholder that will be replaced by `item_title`.
